### Problem

When using the `encodeURI()` function to generate links in a data table within a web application, the URL may be truncated if it contains spaces or other special characters, leading to broken or incomplete links in the user interface.

For example, when encoding a URL like "https://example.com/my page.html" using `encodeURI()`, the space is converted to `%20`, resulting in a truncated URL if displayed directly in the user interface.

### Solution

To prevent URLs from being truncated due to spaces or other special characters, `encodeURI()` can be used along with the `decodeURI()` function to ensure that URLs are correctly displayed in the user interface.

The process involves encoding the URL before displaying it in the user interface using `encodeURI()` and then decoding it again before accessing it. This ensures that special characters are handled correctly and that the URL is displayed and used properly.

```javascript
// Encode the URL before displaying it in the user interface
var encodedURL = encodeURI(url);

// Display the encoded URL in the user interface
return '<a href="' + encodedURL + '" class="px-3 text-primary"><i class="uil uil-eye font-size-18"></i></a>';

// Decode the URL before accessing it
var decodedURL = decodeURI(encodedURL);
```

By using this technique, it ensures that URLs are correctly displayed in the user interface and that links function properly regardless of the special characters they contain.
